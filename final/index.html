    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>
      The game development process started with understanding the rules of Lights Out and breaking them down into toggle logic. The logic was implemented to toggle a single square and its neighbors, ensuring a simple yet functional gameplay mechanic.
    </p>

    <h3>Creative Choices</h3>
    <p>
      Keeping the design minimal was a key decision to make the game approachable and user-friendly. The 5x5 grid size was chosen as it provides a balance between complexity and playability. Subtle transitions were added to improve visual feedback for player actions.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
    <p>
      Ensuring all edge cases were handled properly when toggling neighboring cells was challenging. Additionally, determining if the grid is in a solved state required careful handling of state checks for each cell in the grid. Debugging these issues helped refine the logic and improve overall game stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Insights Gained</h3>
    <p>
      This project reinforced the importance of breaking problems into smaller parts. Implementing and testing grid-based logic was an excellent learning experience, especially for understanding how to manipulate the DOM efficiently. It also emphasized the role of feedback in gameplay, as subtle animations significantly improved user engagement.
