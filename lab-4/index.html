      <h2>Addendum: Explanation of Stylistic Choices</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Font Choices:</strong> As for the font, I chose ‘Arial’ as my
        base font because it may be a universal, versatile font, it goes well
        with professional resume because of its simple, sans-serif form that
        improves the readability. It makes sure that passage can be readable on
        all platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> It has been made this way to look
        professional, the main heading has a font size of 36px while the
        subheadings have a font size of 28px. The body text size is 18px in
        order to avoid loosing readability while using high-res screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Color Choices:</strong> The colours chosen are black and
        lightblue. The text color to work with was chosen as white as they are
        easy to read against the dark color scheme of the book, thus making
        content easy to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Margins and Padding:</strong> I floated all the elements of
        every section and also gave margins and paddings of equal space so that
        the content does not touch each other. This also helps to avoid the
        scenario where some of the characters seem they might come close as to
        join which is not easy to read.
      </p>

      <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
      <p>
        In the previous version of the HTML I utilized the h2 tag for the Main
        Title (my name). For this version, I remedied that in which there were
        no appropriate h1 for the highest level heading as this is semantically
        correct and improves access.
